# News Evaluation with Neural Language Processing

## Quick Summary

This a project I have done as my penultimate assignment with Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. Probably one of the challenging and yet educational I've done so far as I've learnt not only more about the server side using Node.js but also the process of testing using Jest.
